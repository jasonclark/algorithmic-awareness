### COURSE DESCRIPTION

During this course, we will examine what it means to build and design for the mobile platform and how these practices can inform standard web development and design practices. Our emphasis will be on the creation of a working mobile web sketch or app and a series of readings to ground our understanding of what it means to design and develop for mobile settings.

### COURSE OBJECTIVES

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

* Apply best practices for ... 

* Identify the primary methods of algorithm design

* Model an app experience and design a prototype sketch or app

* Assess and evaluate algorithms in actions.


### COURSE POLICIES

**Academic Honesty**: I follow the academic standards for cheating and plagiarism set forth by the University of Wisconsin.

**Readings and software**: We donâ€™t have a textbook for this course; readings are listed on the syllabus. Check Canvas for required software installations.

**Contacting me**: For any difficulty with the course that is not private or confidential, please ask in class or use the Canvas help forum. I am not available on weekends, but I will try to be prompt in answering course and forum questions and email within 2 business days.

### COURSE FORMAT, ASSIGNMENTS, and GRADING

The class will consist of online lectures and discussion, as well as required readings. 20 minute lectures will be conducted every Friday morning in a Canvas course session. Each week there will be a short assignment related to the topic for the week and an expectation that you post about one of the required readings. The course has a single project in which you produce a mobile web app sketch or prototype. Phases of the course project assignment to build your skills around designing and developing mobile experiences will be assigned periodically. The series/phases of course assignments over the five weeks will result in your producing a mobile web app sketch or prototype.
