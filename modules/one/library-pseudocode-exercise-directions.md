# Exercise: "Programming the Library"

In this exercise, we are asking you to think about the common goals, methods, and actions that a person does to navigate and use the library. The work of the exercise is to try to encode these goals and actions into a pseudocode template to introduce "algorithmic thinking" to your teaching.

## Files

The [PseudoCode template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonclark/algorithmic-awareness/master/modules/one/library-pseudocode-exercise-template.py) along with [a potential answer file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonclark/algorithmic-awareness/master/modules/one/library-pseudocode-exercise-answer.py) are located within our class modules.

## Directions

 1. Open [PseudoCode template](https://github.com/jasonclark/algorithmic-awareness/blob/master/modules/one/library-pseudocode-exercise-template.py) in a text editor.
 2. Work  through adding  values  and  encoding  decisions individually. NOTE: One goal is complex, you will need to add methods.
 3. Come back together to discuss.
