# Exercise: "Programming the Library"

**Purpose**: Provide a theorized example of the workings of an algorithm. In addition, giving an introduction to coding with a balance between technical and comprehensive learning 

**Goals** 

* Program the different goals and actions of a library
* Demonstrate both the complexity of coding and how it may be intimidating to most patrons while also showing how do-able it is to edit 

In this exercise, we are asking you to think about the common goals, methods, and actions that a person does to navigate and use the library. The work of the exercise is to try to encode these goals and actions into a pseudocode template to introduce "algorithmic thinking" to your teaching.

## Files

The [PseudoCode template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonclark/algorithmic-awareness/master/modules/one/library-pseudocode-exercise-template.py) along with [a potential answer file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonclark/algorithmic-awareness/master/modules/one/library-pseudocode-exercise-answer.py) are located within our class modules.

## Directions

 1. Open [PseudoCode template](https://github.com/jasonclark/algorithmic-awareness/blob/master/modules/one/library-pseudocode-exercise-template.py) in a text editor.
 2. Work  through adding  values  and  encoding  decisions individually or in pairs. NOTE: One goal is complex, you will need to add methods. *Try not to worry about the technicalities of the code, PseudoCode does not follow any particular syntax, but is just the primary steps for a programmer to follow.*
 3. Come back together to discuss.

## Discussion Questions

* What were some goals?
* How did you decide on locations and actions?
* How do you view the role of a programmer?
* What are some of the challenges programmers may face when creating algorithms?
