The Montana State University Library has received funding from the Institute of Museum and Library
Services through a Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program planning grant under the National Digital
Platform category to conduct an environmental scan of the field’s knowledge of algorithms, develop a proof of
concept search application employing common algorithms, and create an Open Education Resource (OER)
curriculum and pilot class that will be taught to librarians to improve our digital literacy around the algorithms
that define our online experiences and shape our world. 

The planning grant will primarily support releasing a curriculum focused on algorithmic
awareness; teaching a pilot course on algorithmic awareness for librarians; developing a proof of concept
application showing algorithms in practice; engaging with experts in the field to shape the curriculum via 1
online sessions and an in-person meeting; conducting testing/evaluation of librarian and library patron’s
awareness of algorithms and their role in our digital experiences; and traveling for project discussion and
dissemination. This year-long project has three phases.
